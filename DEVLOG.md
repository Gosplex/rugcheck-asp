# RugCheck — dev log & hackathon notes

Internal build notes for the **OKX.AI Genesis Hackathon**. Product docs live in [README.md](README.md).

**Live:** https://rugcheck-asp.onrender.com (Render) · repo https://github.com/Gosplex/rugcheck-asp

## Why this project

- **Hackathon:** OKX.AI Genesis Hackathon — $100,000 prize pool, deadline **Jul 17, 2026 23:59 UTC**.
- **Target prizes:** Software Utility ($2,500) + Social Buzz ($1,000). The same ASP can win both.
- **Why it's winnable fast:** the real-world use case is clear, the demo is shareable on X, and the
  on-chain data heavy-lifting is available through OKX's Onchain OS tooling.

## What an ASP needs (to list on OKX.AI)

The agent's service must be **reachable by others**. Two delivery paths:

| Path | Needs | Pricing |
|---|---|---|
| **API service (A2MCP)** | A real, deployed, public `https://` endpoint (permanent on-chain) | Pay-per-call, fixed |
| **Agent-to-agent (A2A)** | The OKX A2A communication runtime set up | Negotiable / off-chain |

Plus, for **any** ASP: a **required avatar image** (square logo, uploaded as a file — not a link).
Building the API-service endpoint first keeps both options open (an endpoint can also back an A2A agent later).

## Wallet (Agentic Wallet)

- EVM: `0x841bd75ed39f112356ae1a1210b7a387fea43e19`
- Solana: `bJ7u6t3z8EUR5ym88aFYTuqpGmrQwd5ezeJFRfz3cAa`

## Plan (build code first, register second)

1. **Build the RugCheck service** — an HTTP endpoint that takes a token + chain and returns a structured safety report.
2. **Deploy it** to a public host for a permanent `https://` URL.
3. **Prepare an avatar** — a square logo image file (`assets/logo.png`).
4. **Register the ASP** on OKX.AI with the deployed endpoint URL, pass review, go live.
5. **Record a <90s demo**, post on X with **#OKXAI**.
6. **Submit the Google Form** with ASP details + the X post link **before Jul 17 23:59 UTC**.

## Progress log

- [x] Installed Onchain OS skills + the `onchainos` CLI (v4.2.4); logged into the Agentic Wallet.
- [x] Built the core service: `analyze.js` (fetch + verdict), `server.js` (HTTP API + UI), `page.js`
      (self-contained web UI), `cli-check.js` (terminal tester), `assets/logo.png` (brand/avatar).
- [x] Tested locally: USDC → 🟢 LOW; hot tokens resolve; bad addresses rejected.
- [x] Added the AI analyst layer (`ai.js` → OpenRouter): executive summary, per-risk explanations,
      critical/important/minor prioritization, confidence, scam-pattern recognition, and modes.
- [x] Redesigned the UI (instrument console + AI report + chat). Deep links auto-run.
- [x] Verified graceful degradation with no API key (deterministic scan unaffected).
- [x] Hardened the pipeline:
      - Wrong chain / bad address no longer fakes a "clean 🟢 LOW" verdict → `found:false` → `UNKNOWN`
        with a "check the address and chain" message; AI is skipped on empty data.
      - AI report fields render markdown instead of raw asterisks (`page.js` `fmt()`); fixed an
        unescaped-backtick bug that broke the page template.
      - AI system prompt forbids em/en dashes.
- [x] Branding: `assets/logo.png` (1254×1254 square) as header mark + favicon, served at `/logo.png`.
- [x] Engagement features (frontend-only, engine/AI architecture unchanged):
      - **Explain This** — per-signal Explain buttons, grounded + cached, reusing `/chat` (no new AI pipeline).
      - **Share Card** + **Post on X** — branded canvas card, reusing the AI executive summary (no extra AI call).
      - QoL: example tokens, copy address + explorer link, recent scans, verified line, skeleton, toasts.
- [x] Swapped `runReport()` from the `onchainos` CLI to the **OKX Web3 HTTP API** (`https://web3.okx.com`),
      so it deploys anywhere. **Verified live with a real key.** Exact calls:
      - `POST /api/v6/dex/market/token/basic-info` — body `[{chainIndex, tokenContractAddress}]`
      - `POST /api/v6/dex/market/price-info` — body `[{chainIndex, tokenContractAddress}]`
      - `POST /api/v6/security/token-scan` — body `{source:"1", tokenList:[{chainId, contractAddress}]}`
      - `GET  /api/v6/dex/market/token/advanced-info` — query `chainIndex`, `tokenContractAddress`
      - Auth: `OK-ACCESS-KEY/SIGN/TIMESTAMP/PASSPHRASE/PROJECT` (HMAC-SHA256). Auto HTTP when
        `OKX_API_KEY` is set, else CLI; force with `RUGCHECK_SOURCE=http|cli`.
      - Smoke: USDC/ETH → 🟢 OK, PEPE/ETH → 🟢 OK, USDC-on-Solana (wrong chain) → UNKNOWN/`found:false`.

- [x] Deployed to Render → **https://rugcheck-asp.onrender.com** (env vars set in the dashboard).
- [x] Verified live in production: `/health` 200, `/ai-status` enabled (`anthropic/claude-opus-4.8`),
      and a full `/rugcheck?...&ai=1` scan of USDC → 🟢 OK / LOW / score 24 with an AI summary and no
      `aiError` — the OKX HTTP data path + AI enrichment both work on the host.
- [x] Keep-warm: UptimeRobot pings `/health` every 5 min so the Render free instance never idles out
      (~15-min sleep → ~50s cold start otherwise). Note: intermittent `x-render-routing: no-server`
      404s were seen during a deploy transition, unrelated to any query param (`/health` flapped too).

- [x] Accepted OKX.AI marketplace terms (one-time wallet consent for `0x841bd75…a43e19`; ASP pre-check
      now returns `canCreate:true`, aspCount 0).

- [x] Built the **MCP endpoint** (`mcp.js` → `POST /mcp`, Streamable HTTP, stateless) exposing a
      `rugcheck` tool over the same engine — for the A2MCP path. UI + REST untouched. Verified locally:
      initialize / tools/list / tools/call (USDC → OK) / bad-address error / notification 202.

- [x] Confirmed via official OKX docs that **free A2MCP is supported** (price 0, HTTP 200, no x402) —
      so no payment plumbing needed. Our `/mcp` already returns 200, matching the free-endpoint spec.
- [x] Registered the ASP on-chain (XLayer, chainIndex 196): **RugCheck AI**, Agent **#5996**,
      tx `0xf90a3c26701377e872b869ca4ad3a631d4debccbcd6cf8b3f60388b4102b7fe6`. Endpoint
      `https://rugcheck-asp.onrender.com/mcp`, type A2MCP, fee 0. Listing passed OKX `validate-listing`
      (`pass:true`). Avatar: `assets/logo-512.png` (512², 272 KB) uploaded to the OKX CDN.
- [x] Set up the OKX A2A comms runtime (required to activate): Node 22 via nvm → `npm i -g
      @okxweb3/a2a-node` (0.1.9) → `okx-a2a doctor --fix` (`ready:true`, daemon pid running,
      launchd autostart installed).
- [x] Submitted activation for review (`activate` + `submitApproval`) → **pending OKX approval**;
      review messages arrive in `en-US` via the comms channel.

### Remaining
- [ ] Await OKX approval → RugCheck AI becomes publicly listed/hireable.
- [ ] Record demo, post on X (#OKXAI), submit Google Form before the deadline.

## Notes / risks

- The endpoint URL is **permanent on-chain** once registered — lock in the host before registering.
- OKX free-tier API has rate limits (`50011 Too Many Requests`); RugCheck fires 4 calls per scan.
- Secrets have passed through local files during setup — **rotate the OKX key** before any public push.
- RugCheck presents factual on-chain data only; it must never give investment advice.
